On request create, an address is shown that has nothing to do with the current linked wallet addresses on Request Finance.
For example https://pay.request.network/01eb6ba2392160a0d937bb5977f08b03db51552c555ff6eae6a9c608ba2a986e54. Unknow wallet address to user.
Not enough funds: 'You do not have sufficient funds. Please add [object Object] to your wallet to pay this request.'

request params: 
 - `value` = payee address. Change value to _to or _receiver or ...
  - 'type`': More information needed about the different types & networks (see line 11)

API key can be copied from Request Finance. Shouldn't be gated behind finance?

native tokens type: 'eth-input-data', ERC20 type 'erc20-proxy-contract'. This is lacking in the documentation.
Also see https://github.com/RequestNetwork/requestNetwork/blob/master/packages/advanced-logic/specs/payment-network-eth-input-data-0.2.0.md#payment-network---eth---input-data
-> This extension allows the payments and the refunds to be made in Ether on the Ethereum blockchain, or in any native token of an EVM chain. A payment reference has to be given when making the transfer to link the payment to the request.

Supported networks for pay.request.network??: mainnet
